We appreciate anyone who can offer skills towards the project (additions and refinements), and there is a desire for volunteers who can assist in the following roles/tasks:
- App designer (improving Tero Subtitler's UI and UX)
- Coders (resolving issues and developing features)
- Localization (reaching more people)
- Manual editor (for Tero Subtitler)

- Users can join our Discord channel for queries and discussions (using the relevant category).

## History

URUWorks' subtitling solution began as Subtitle Workshop. In making the distinction from the other project with the same name, the organization is retiring that repository in favor of Tero Subtitler.

## Donations

Not only will you help them continue to be free and improved, but it implies to the members of URUWorks that their work is valued and appreciated, thus encouraging the investment of time and resources as part of our mission to provide all user bases with better apps and support.
